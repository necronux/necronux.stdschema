We track licenses in two ways:

- For in-tree source files, we use [REUSE](https://reuse.software) to track licensing details via `REUSE.toml` and individual file headers.
  This information is used to generate SPDX bill of materials (SBOM) in the file `reuse.spdx`, which is shipped at each release.
- For out-of-tree dependencies, we manually track licensing details in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES`.

Both `reuse.spdx` and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES` are shipped with each release of necronux.stdschema
Please refer to these files for detailed information as to the components of any given necronux.stdschema release.
